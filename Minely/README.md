# Welcome to Minely
## A project as a demo for my IS601 Spring 2020 class to use as reference
##### Build a mining empire! Buy land lots, hire workers, and gather various resources and become the most successful!
[Original Project Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A9VVx-3nTT_jgayArqnIGfpveInO3NATv3FmbP_vPUU/edit "Google Doc Link")
-[x] User can register a new account with a unique email address
-[x] User can login with a valid email address and password
-[x] User passwords should not be stored in plain text
-[x] User can logout; their session should be destroyed and the only way back in should be login page
-[x] User will be able to acquire land lot
    -[x] Given 1 at start (not given, but first costs zero)
-[x] Purchase extra lots as the game progresses
-[x] Starting price will be x “coins” and will be multiplied by 1.5? for each future land lot
    - Followed a bit different algorithm (To Be Updated)
-[x] Land lot will get a random set of resource producers
    -[ ] Trees
        -[x] Various types to produce different qualities of wood
    -[x] Mineral Deposits
        -[x] Various types to produce different ore
    -[x] Resource producers deplete after x material has been gathered
    -[ ] User can spend “coin” to survey the land lot of another random resource
-[x] User will be able to hire workers
-[x] Workers can work any job type
-[ ] Workers will have potentially unique stats
    -[x] Name
    -[x] Sprite? Just using basis css
    -[x] Cooldown time
    -[x] Efficiency (# of items from “gathering” activity)
        - mix of skill and efficiency
    -[x] Health
-[ ]There will be 3 job types
    -[x] Woodcutter
        -[x]Cuts trees (just gathers resource, no special distinction)
    -[x] Miner
        -[x]Mines ore (just gathers resource, no special distinction)
    -[ ] Smelter
        -[ ]Smelts ore to Ingots
-[ ]User will be able to use resources to build tools
    -[ ] Types (from wood and Ingots)
    -[ ] Axes
    -[ ] Pickaxes
    -[ ] Smelter’s Kit
    -[ ] Tools will increase job efficiency
    -[ ] Tools degrade with use
    -[ ] Durability is random per material type (i.e., [basic wood] Random(1,10))
-[ ] User will be able to trade workers
    - They can offer them a better job (which puts them on the market and player receives a commission (kind of like a headhunter))
    -[ ] Implement actual trading system so resources can be part of the deal
-[ ] User will be able to trade resources
-[ ] Trades will have a “coin” fee when listing regardless of successful trade/sale
-[ ]Trades can be any of the following
    -[ ] resources to coins
    -[ ] coins to resources
    -[ ] resources to resources
-[ ] There will be public scoreboards based on the following
    -[ ] Weekly
        -[ ] Most gold generated this week
        -[ ] Most resource X generated this week (x will be for each resource type)
        -[ ] Top 3 will be awarded “coins”
    -[ ] All-time
        -[ ] Gold generation
        -[ ] Combined resource generation
### Reach Goals
-[ ] Natural disasters will occur to affect resources
-[ ] Natural disasters will occur to affect workers
-[ ] Workers can be healed via food
    -[ ] Only purchasable from “shop”
